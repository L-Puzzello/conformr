# What are Panel maps? (Conceptual)

_Panel Maps_ are the architectural blueprints of your combined dataset. It specifies instructions for combining and splitting values from source classification into a target classification.

# How-to create Panel Maps from... (How to Guide)

One of the key steps in the `{conformr}` workflow is the creation of _Panel Maps_. The following sections provide example code for generating _Panel Maps_ from a variety of sources. Familiarity with the specific classifications, which are chosen purely for illustration purposes, is not necessary.

# Panel Maps, the tidy way

Note that these examples use a number of external packages, in particular `{tidyverse}`. This is to demonstrate how easily `{conformr}` can fit into existing tidy workflows.

## Correspondence Tables..

### Equal weight split
Say you have a correspondence table which specifies the complete connections between two code structures, how do you turn that table into a _Panel Map_?

Let's create a Panel Map to transform <<<<trade data>>>>> from version <<x>> of the [Harmonised System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonized_System) (`HS1_6d`) to NAICS (`code_out`) at the 6 digit code level. First, we import the relevant correspondence table, and then select the columns with the source and target codes. 
```{r HS1_to_NAICS_6d_panel_map}
library(concordance)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

# import the correspondence table
code_dict <- concordance::hs1_naics %>%
  distinct(HS1_6d, NAICS_6d)

# make a panel map, with equal weight splits
pm_df <- code_dict %>%
  group_by(HS1_6d) %>%
  mutate(n_dest = n(),
         HS1_split = 1/n_dest) %>%
  select(-n_dest)

# OR use the built-in to_equal_panel_map() function
panel_map <- make_equal_panel_map(code_dict, HS1_6d, NAICS_6d)

# check that it is a panel map
HS1_to_NAICS_6d_map

# TODO: conformr::is_panel_map(HS1_to_NAICS_6d_map)
```
Notice that we kept only the unique combinations of HS1 & NAICS using `dplyr::distinct()`. We use `distinct` ensure that we have the correct denominator for splitting up values that are part of a 1-to-many split. See the [Verification of Panel Maps]() vignette for more details.


### Weighted Split

TODO: Example of population weighted splits
```{r ASCO-ANZSCO}
# remotes::install_github("runapp-aus/strayr")
library(strayr)

# download correspondence table from ABS
## get(https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/F30E72E1516495BDCA2575DF001C7441/$File/12200%20anzsco%20first%20edition%20revision%201%20to%20asco%20second%20edition%20correspondence%20tables.xls)

## 
```


## From existing scripts

TODO: Example of extracting panel map from for loops
```{r }
# scrub value_in to be 1
input_data$value_in <-

# pass through to script

# output table will be a panel map

```


## Grouped Panel Maps

TODO: add example with different map by group -- e.g. 8 digit HS to 6 digit international HS
